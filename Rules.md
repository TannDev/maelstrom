# Rules
The following rules provide a framework to help a storytellers and players build their characters, take challenging actions, snd get in fights. As with other roleplaying games, it's important to remember that the rules are only there to support the story and not to get in the way of it; storytellers are encouraged to adjust the rules where necessary to make things more fun, cinematic, or engaging.

## Actions
Characters do many things in the world; they drive cars, fly spaceships, shoot guns, investigate crime scenes, and so much more. Many of these actions are mundane or trivial and only require saying what your character is doing. (Nobody wants to roll die to eat breakfast or drive their car through normal traffic.) For everything else, characters use their attributes and abilies, along with some dice, to determine if they succeed, fail, or royally screw things up.

### Selecting an action
The first step of performaing an action is to decide what your character is going to do and announce it. You might say, for example, "I hop on the motorcycle and fire it up." For many actions, this is all that's required. But for some actions, the storyteller may have you roll for it. The storyteller should take the situation into account as well when deciding whether players should roll. After all, it's really easy to start a motorcycle in your driveway for a lazy drive but it's a whole other thing to start it while under fire and trying to escape with your life.

Some actions are also just straight up impossible. No matter how much you say "I fly like a bird!" the only thing your character will end up doing is flapping their arms like a lunatic. Generally, the storyteller won't have you roll for these and just tell you that you fail or suggest that your character would know it was impossible before you even attempt it. However, a particularly mean storyteller may have you roll anyway, purely to determine exactly how hilariously you screw up.

When you announce an action that your storteller wants you to roll for, they'll decide which traits you'll need to use as well as how difficult the action is. The selected traits will make up your dice pool for the action: one die per dot in each trait.

> **Example**: You're start your motorcycle and get away from the people shooting at you. The storyteller decides that to get the key in the ignition, start the bike, and take off without stalling it is going to require the precision attribute. Your character has three dots in precision and two dots in drive, so you're going to roll a total of five dice.
