# Rules
The following rules provide a framework to help a storytellers and players build their characters, take challenging actions, snd get in fights. As with other roleplaying games, it's important to remember that the rules are only there to support the story and not to get in the way of it; storytellers are encouraged to adjust the rules where necessary to make things more fun, cinematic, or engaging.

## Actions
Characters do many things in the world; they drive cars, fly spaceships, shoot guns, investigate crime scenes, and so much more. Many of these actions are mundane or trivial and only require saying what your character is doing. (Nobody wants to roll dice to eat breakfast or drive their car through normal traffic.) For everything else, characters use their attributes and abilies, along with some dice, to determine if they succeed, fail, or royally screw things up.

### Declaring an action
The first step of performaing an action is to decide what your character is going to do and announce it. You might say, for example, "I hop on the motorcycle and fire it up." For many actions, this is all that's required. But for some actions, the storyteller may have you roll for it. The storyteller should take the situation into account as well when deciding whether players should roll. After all, it's really easy to start a motorcycle in your driveway for a lazy drive but it's a whole other thing to start it while under fire and trying to escape with your life.

Some actions are also just straight up impossible. No matter how much you say "I fly like a bird!" the only thing your character will end up doing is flapping their arms like a lunatic. Generally, the storyteller won't have you roll for these and just tell you that you fail or suggest that your character would know it was impossible before you even attempt it. However, a particularly mean storyteller may have you roll anyway, purely to determine exactly how hilariously you screw up.

While most things your character does are technically actions, you generally need to think about them individually. Outside of combat, players should just roleplay their characters, decide what they want to do, and do it. Try to avoid things like "Can I make a stealth check?" or "What do I need to roll to search the room?" Instead, just describe what your character is doing: "I blend into the crowd and try to get out the back unnoticed" or "I grab my forensics kit and search the room, looking for anything that might be relevant to the case."  When a roll is needed, the storyteller will say so.

### The Dice Pool
When you announce an action that your storteller wants you to roll for, they'll decide which traits you'll need to use. Usually, this will be an attribute and an ability. However, occasionally be one or two attributes without an ability. While there may sometimes be only one trait used, there should never be more than two. The number of dice you'll roll, called your dice pool, is determined how many dots you have in each of those traits: one die per dot for each trait.

> **Example:** You're taking fire and decide to start your motorcycle and get away. The storyteller thinks that getting the key in the ignition, starting the bike, and taking off without stalling it is going to require precise movements and familiarity with the bike. She says to roll Precision + Drive. Your character has three dots in Precision and two dots in Drive, so your dice pool contains a total of five dice.

Many actions can be accomplished in many different ways and with many different traits. Rather than just stating which action you'd like to perform, it's usually better to describe how you're trying to go about it. This will help the storyteller determine which traits to use and makes sure that your character performs the action in the way you intended. This also helps build your character's personality and demeanor in the minds of other players and leads to a richer roleplaying experience for everyone.

After you declare an action, the storyteller may offer a choice of different ways of performing it. They may also tell you which traits would be used for each option. While it can be tempting to just use whichever option gives you the larger dice pool, it's important to consider your character's personality and what their objectives are. Just because you're better at doing something a certain way doesn't necessarily mean that's the right way to try and do it. Keep in mind that different approaches may have different difficulties as well, so just having more dice doesn't mean it's going to be easier.

> **Example:** "I'm going to make my way through the crowd and follow the target." you announce. The storyteller asks you if you'd like to push and shove people out of the way with Strength + Brawling or slip through gaps in the crowd with Precision + Streetwise. You know you'd have more dice if you brute force your way through but you also know that your character wouldn't want to make a big scene and draw attention. So, you decide to take the smaller dice pool and slip through the crowd instead.

### Difficulty
Once you've decded what you're going to do and gotten your dice pool, the storyteller should specify a difficulty. Some storytellers will use the default difficulty for most actions and only mention it when it's different, rather than saying it every time. Your storyteller should make it clear how they intend to do this.

While the difficulty can be set anywhere between two and ten, it will usually be between four and eight with most actions having the default difficulty of six. When you roll your dice, you will get one success for each die which shows the difficulty number or higher. Additionally, you'll also get a failure for each die which shows a one. You lose one success for each failure and the total number of successes remaining then determines how well your character does. If manage to roll a failure without getting any successes at all, you botch the roll and fail spectacularly.

>**Example:** A player is taking an action with dice pool of five and a difficulty of six. He rolls and gets 1, 3, 4, 6, 7. Two dice are showing a six or better, so he gets two successes. But he also rolled a one and loses a success, for a total of one success remaining. Had the difficulty been higher, he would have wound up with zero successes and potentially botched the roll entirely.

### Threshold
For particularly challenging or dangerous actions, the story teller may specify a threshold. This represents how much effort it's going to take just to have a chance to succeed. Having a threshold means you are much more likely to fail and dramatically increases the chance of you failing catastrophically.

When you have a threshold, any successes you get up to that amount are removed immediately. Not only do they not count towards your total successes, they don't even count for botched rolls.

> **Example:** A player rolls for their action with a threshold of two. They roll two successes and a failure. The two successes are then immediately removed by the threshold, leaving zero successes and a failure. This is a botch, even though the roll would have been pretty good without the threshold.

### Specialty
If you use a an attribute that your character has a specialty in, you can sometimes use that specialty to increase your odds of success.

You can only use a attribute's specialty if you have at least four dots in the attribute and if you are using that attribute to perform some action related to the specialty. Using a specialty doesn't directly add to the dice pool, but it does allow for a chance of getting bonus dice on good role. Whenever you role a 10 on a die while using a specialty, you have the option to roll an additional die. This includes the additional dice as well, so you could theoretically roll an unlimited number of successes.

Keep in mind, however, that with great power comes great responsibility. Each additional die you roll has the potential to be a 1 and cancel out success you already got. If you've already got enough successes to perform the action you want, sometimes it's better not to roll the extra die.

> **Example:** A player is trying to attack with a sniper rifle. The attack uses Precision and Firearms and has a difficulty of 8. Her character has three dots in Precision and four dots in Firearms with a specialty in sniping. Because she has at least four dots in Firearms and is taking a relevant action, she's allowed to use the speciality. She rolls seven dice as usual and gets 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10 for two successes. Because of the ten, she's able to roll another die as well and rolls another 8 for a total of three successes. Had she rolled a 1 instead, she'd have wound up with a single success, potentially dealing less damage.

### Resolving the Result
Once you've determined your action, dice pool, and difficulty, it's time for some of that sweet, sweet randomness.

#### Step 1: Roll
Roll a number of ten-sided dice equal to your dice pool.

If you're using one of your character's specialties, you may roll an additional die for each die that shows a 10.
  
#### Step 2: Count Successes
Count how many dice are showing a number equal to or greater than your difficulty number; these are your successes.

If you have a threshold, immediately remove that number of successes. Any successes removed in this way don't count at all and aren't considered cancelled; they effectively never happened at all. (Note: this affects successes, not the dice themselves. So it does not prevent you from adding additional dice by using a speciality. It can still remove successes from added dice, however.)
  
#### Step 3: Subtract Failures
Ones are bad. Count how many dice are showing a 1; these are your failures. Each failure you roll cancels one of your successes.

#### Step 4: Succeed, Fail, or Botch
If you still have any successes, then congratulations! You've suceeded your action. How well you did is determined by how many successes you still have. For most actions, a single success is enough to just barely make it while three or more means you did a really good job. The storyteller will describe your action and the potentially-glorious result.

If you had no successes or failures, or if all your successes were cancelled, then you've simply failed. You weren't able to accomplish what you tried to do. You missed your shot, lost the person you were following, or couldn't hack the computer. The storyteller will describe what went wrong. Still, it could have been worse...

If you rolled any failures without rolling any successes (including cancelled ones), then you've botched. Not only did you fail, but things went very wrong. Perhaps the part you were trying to fix is permentantly broke, or you gun is jammed, or you've crashed and ruined your car. Whatever it was, the storyteller will describe uncomfortable results of your utter failure ...usually in graphic detail.

#### Easy Counting Trick
All this counting of dice can sound a little complicated and slow at first.

Fortunately, there's actually a really easy way to figure out your result quickly:
1. After you've rolled your dice, pick out the successes and failures. Remove the res.
1. If you have a threshold, take that many of the successes and remove them.
1. If you have no successes but at least one failure, you've botched.
1. Pair up successess with failures and remove each pair.
1. If you have any successes left, that's how well you succeed.
1. If you don't have any successes left, you've failed.

### Storyteller Suggestions
Even after you've figured out what traits to use for your player's action, determining what difficulties and thresholds to set can be tricky sometimes. This section provides some suggestions and tables to make it a little bit easier. However, it'll also vary greatly depending on what sort of game you're running and how much of a challenge you and your players want. Start with the guidelines here and then adjust to suit your story and your players.

#### Determining Difficulty
Importantly, the difficulty should never change _after_ the dice have been rolled.
<!-- TODO Describe how to determine what the difficulty should be -->
(_Oh no! There's a section missing here! Don't worry, I'm sure it'll turn up._)

At difficulty 10, a single die is as likely to botch as it is to succeed. Higher than that and success is completely impossible, since you can't roll an 11 on a ten-sided die. Because of this, it's usually a good idea to add a threshold instead of increasing the difficulty above 8 or 9.

#### Determining Thresholds
Some actions are so difficult that a simple success isn't enough and one or more successes are needed just to break even before progress can be made. For these actions, the storyteller can set a "threshold" of success. This threshold counts against any successes a character rolls, _before_ any ones are are counted. This not only makes it harder to get a success, but also makes it easier to botch. A little threshold goes a long way.

Usually, a threshold is used to set a task that is just extremely difficult to perform. In these cases, the action's difficulty is also set high. Just be sure to keep in mind that, with a high difficulty, the average number of rolled successes will be low. At difficulty 9, even a threshold of 1 makes for an extremely challenging feat. The odds of a botch are high and odds of failure even higher.

Thresholds can also be used to make tasks that aren't particularly difficult, but where there's a lot that can go wrong. This represents the need of the character to get a bunch of things right in order to succeed in their objective. In these cases, the action's difficulty is set lower -- somtimes even lower than normal -- and a reasonable threshold is used.

> **Example:** "You climb the stairs and find yourself at the landing pad. There's no railings here, but there's a guard standing near the edge ahead of you. It's really windy all the way up here but you're pretty sure the metalic floor will make it extremely hard to sneak past him without being heard." describes the storyteller. The player decides she wants to charge the guard and push him over the edge before he can react.
>
> Considering the situation, the storyteller offers a choice: "It'd be so, so easy to budge him off the ledge, but you recognize that the loud, slippery floor makes this super dangerous. In game terms, it'll be strength plus athletics at difficulty 5 and a 2 threshhold. You gonna go for it?" The player's character has pretty good stats and she decides to risk it. She picks up the dice...
>
> With a threshold of two, the player will immediately discard two successes from her roll. If she has no remaining successes and any ones, she botches. Otherwise, she subtracts her ones from her successes as usual. There's a few possible outcomes:
> - If she has at least one success remaining, she'll successfully push the guard off the edge. Only one success might give her a bit of a frightening close call, while more will have her move quickly and quietly.
> - If she has no remaining successes, but didn't botch, the guard hears her coming and pushes her back. They're both still on the platform but it's probably going to be a pretty scary fight.
> - If she botched, she successfully pushes the guard but slips and goes over the edge as well. The storyteller offers a reflex + strength check to try and grab onto the edge just in time.
