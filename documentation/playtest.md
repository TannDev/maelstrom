### Donager
The Donager is BlackStar Expeditionary Cruiser.

#### Specs:
- **Class:** Expeditionary Cruiser
- **Armor Value:** 6
- **Hull Value:** 3

#### Armament
##### PDCs

- **Range:** 3km (6 tiles)
- **Damage:** 3 per battery
- **Rate of Fire:** 1
- **Batteries:** 4

**Linked Batteries:** Gunners are able to link the firing controls of multiple batteries when engaging a single target. Doing so gets +2 damage dice per additional battery but consumes the RoF for _all_ batteries used.

**Anti-missile Fire:** PDCs are able to defend against enemy missiles. Each battery can engage incoming missiles in it's firing arc. Each success destroys 1 incoming missile per battery used.

**Field of Fire:** The PDC batteries are arranged along the length of the ship. Each battery is able to engage a roughly 180-degree, allowing two batteries to simultaneously engage a single target at the top, bottom, left, or right or the ship. They have limited effectiveness directly fore and aft as individual turrets obstruct each other.

##### Heavy Missiles
Missiles is equipped with two heavy missile batteries. These provide the Donager with high-damage offensive capabilities but have have limited sustainability in long-term engagements. Additionally, do to the small maximum volley size, fired missiles are extremely vulnerable to defensive fire from PDCs.

- **Damage:** 7
- **Rate of Fire:** 1
- **Batteries:** 2
- **Capacity:** 8
- **Reserve Ammo:** None

- **Range:** 10km (20 tiles) per turn
- **Damage:** 1  per missile
- **Volley Size:** 12
- **Rate of Fire** 1
- **Capacity:** 6 Volleys
