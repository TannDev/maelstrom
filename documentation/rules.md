# Rules
The following rules provide a framework to help storytellers and players build their characters, take challenging actions, and get in fights. As with other roleplaying games, it's important to remember that the rules are only there to support the story and not to get in the way of it; storytellers are encouraged to adjust the rules where necessary to make things more fun, cinematic, and engaging.

## Characters
Characters make up the core of any roleplaying game. Your character is your avatar in the game world and they will define who you are and what you are able to do. They are how you interact with the story and with other players. Because of this, the characters in Maelstrom are designed to be flexible. When you [create your character](#creating-a-character), you'll select a set of backgrounds, traits, and equipment that will help you play the _person_ you want to play.

### Backgrounds
Everyone comes from somewhere and everyone has a story to tell; your character is no exception.

Backgrounds help you flesh out that story and add depth to your character's personality and experience. They provide insight into your character's life before you came to inhabit them and before the campaign. This insight is helpful to you as a player, so you can develop a sense of who they are and what they would do or say, but also to the storyteller who will be building worlds for them to explore. This chapter begins with backgrounds because _who your character is_ matters a lot more than _what they can do_.

( _Unfortunately, this section seems to have gone missing. So, uh... write a story or something!_ )
<!-- TODO Describe backgrounds -->

### Traits
Traits define what your character is capable of and are divided into [Attributes](#attributes), [Abilities](#abilities), [Specialties](#specialties), and [Willpower](#willpower). These are what you'll use to [perform actions](#performing-actions).

#### Attributes
Attributes are the intrinsic traits that broadly define the overall capabilities of a character. All characters have at least one dot in all attributes -- except under extreme exceptions -- with two dots being the human average. Almost all player characters will have 3-4 dots in a few attributes and some characters may have fewer than two dots in one or more attributes.

##### Physical
The physical attributes define the physical capabilities of a character.

###### Strength
Strength is pure muscle power and endurance. It's used for running, lifting, carrying, punching, and other activities where the limiting factor is the raw amount of physical effort the character is able to exert. It is also used to safely absorb certain types of damage.
- **0**: Abysmal. You can barely even move under your own power. Most children are stronger than you. (Lift 20lbs)
- **1**: Poor. You're a couch potato. (Lift 40lbs)
- **2**: Average. You can probably do a couple pushups. (Lift 100lbs)
- **3**: Good. You work out or do heavy work for a living. (Lift 250lbs)
- **4**: Exceptional. You win Strong Man competitions. (Lift 400lbs)
- **5**: Outstanding. You are the Mountain that Rides. (Lift 600lbs)

###### Precision
Precision is hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity. It's used for acrobatics, parkour, thrown weapons, aimed shots, driving, and other activities where the limiting factor is the precision and accuracy of the character's motions.
- **0**: Abysmal. Walking is hard. Falling down is easy.
- **1**: Poor. You sometimes trip over perfectly smooth floors.
- **2**: Average. You usually at least hit the dart board and you can probably cross a balance beam.
- **3**: Good. You get bullseyes regularly and can cross a tight rope.
- **4**: Exceptional. You win dart competitions and parkour across rooftops.
- **5**: Outstanding. You're Deadshot, if he was in Cirque du Soleil.

**Note:** Precise movements usually require a small amount of planning, so sudden or unexpected actions usually cannot be performed with Precision and require Reflexes instead.

###### Reflexes
Reflexes is reacting and taking actions quickly. It's used for quickdraws, dodging, unaimed shots, evasive maneuvers, and other activities where the limiting factor is reaction time.
- **0**: Abysmal. You're even surprised by your own actions.
- **1**: Poor. Sloths respond faster than you.
- **2**: Average. You can dodge a wrench (or a ball) if it's slow enough.
- **3**: Good. You can shoot from a holster and handle a fighter.
- **4**: Exceptional. You win speed shooting and drone racing competitions.
- **5**: Outstanding. Your quickdraw is better than Wyatt Earp.

**Note:** It's harder to do things in a hurry, so actions will usually carry a higher difficulty when performed with Reflexes instead of Precision.

##### Mental
The mental attributes define the mental capabilities of a character.

###### Perception
Perception is the ability to take in and process stimuli. It's used for searching, keeping watch, spotting threats, and other activities where the limiting factor is the ability to see, hear, feel, or smell.
- **0**: Abysmal. A fire alarm can go off without you noticing it.
- **1**: Poor. People sneak up on you without meaning to.
- **2**: Average. You lose your phone occasionally, but usually find it again.
- **3**: Good. You could be a detective or guard.
- **4**: Exceptional. Where's Waldo is too easy.
- **5**: Outstanding. Nothing escapes your notice. You see all.

###### Intelligence
Intelligence is the capacity to learn and apply information. It's used for research, mathematics, logical problem solving, and other activities where the limiting factor is education or reasoning. A character with high intelligence is good at reasoning through problems and will tend to figure things out slowly and methodically. If successful, they will usually fully understand the situation and be confident in their solution.
- **0**: Abysmal. Ogg not know how make pointy stick. (Illiterate)
- **1**: Poor. You ain't much fer book learning. (High school or Less)
- **2**: Average. You can do your own taxes more or less correctly. (College/Trade School)
- **3**: Good. You can do other people's taxes correctly. (Post-Graduate/Master)
- **4**: Exceptional. You're a well known and respected thinker in your field.
- **5**: Outstanding. Hawking, Einstein, Tesla, Faraday... and you.

###### Wits
Wits is the capacity for cleverness and intuition. It's used for trial-and-error experimentation, intuitive problem solving, out-of-the-box thinking, and other activities where the limiting factor is the ability to think quickly or creatively. A character with high wits is good at thinking on their feed and will tend to figure things out quickly but imprecisely. They may be prone to flip switches without fully understanding what they do.
- **0**: Abysmal. There's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza.
- **1**: Poor. Even with a map, you always get lost if you try and take a shortcut.
- **2**: Average. You've mostly got the whole "adulting" thing figured out.
- **3**: Good. You're pretty decent with a crossword puzzle.
- **4**: Exceptional. Your innovative ideas revolutionize small industries.
- **5**: Outstanding. The Enterprise crew doesn't come up with solutions as clever as yours.

#### Abilities
Abilities are the learned or developed traits that define the specific things a character knows how to do.
Many player characters will have 3-4 dots in a few abilities and almost all characters will have a couple dots in many different abilities.

Most abilities have lists of [attributes](#attributes) and [specialties](#specialties) which are commonly used with that ability.

##### Talents
Talents represent abilities that come naturally to characters, but which may have been honed and trained over the years.
When rolling for talents, there is no penalty for having zero dots -- just use the base attribute alone.

###### Alertness

- **General Specialties:** Terrain (Urban, Forest, Plains, etc), Followers, Ambushes.

###### Athletics
Athletics represents a character's talent for physical agility. Where the physical attributes define a character's raw physical capabilities, their athletics defines their level of training and practice. This could be from physical training, sports, or other physical activities. It is used to do things like jump, climb, throw, and run, as well as for thrown weapons such as knives and grenades.
- **Common Attributes:** Strength, Precision, Reflexes
- **Advanced Specialties:** Grenades, Power Armor, Zero-G, Acrobatics, Parkour, Specific Exotic Thrown Weapon

###### Investigation
Investigation represents a character's talent for gathering evidence, making connections between events, anding find hidden information. It's used to conduct research, process crime scenes, analyse forensics, searching records, and other general skills that might be used to locate information. Most investigation methods require access to people, databases, or other information sources. This can often be acquired lawfully or with proper authorization. But, if not, it can sometimes be obtained via [Tradecraft](#tradecraft).

###### Technology
Technology represents a character's talent for using modern technology. It's used to interact with computer systems to retrieve information, recover lost data, and gain unauthorized access. It is also used with other consumer technology such as communications, security, and navigation systems. While Technology may be used to gain access in to insecure systems, or use pre-written exploits against secure ones, proper software development and hacking requires [Computer Science](#computer-science).
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence, Wits
- **Advanced Specialties:** Hacking, Data Recovery, Data Forgery, AI Modules, Remote Access
- **General Specialties:**  Data Storage, Communications, Security Systems, Navigation Systems

##### Skills
Skills represent abilities that characters have learned through training and practice.

In some cases, the storyteller may allow an alternate roll or action to allow a character to "figure it out" and avoid the penalty.

###### Artistry
Artistry represents a character's skills at creating things via drawing, sculpting, sewing, etc. Unlike [Manufacturing](#manufacturing), the Artistry ability doesn't usually result in useful, precisely-engineered items. However, it can still be used to create useful soft goods such as textiles, maps, documents, and even forgeries.
- **Common Attributes:** Varies
- **Advanced Specialties:** Forgery, Electronics, Metalwork
- **General Specialties:** Sketching, Painting, Sculpting, Photography

###### Driving

- **General Specialties:** Dancing, Singing, Speeches

###### Piloting
Piloting represents a character's skill at operating both aircraft and spacecraft. With the ubiquity of high-efficiency aerospace thrusters, these craft are often quite similar and any character who is able to pilot one is also able to pilot the other. However, atmospheric flight -- along with some other types of maneuvers -- are generally more difficult. Additionally, is only used to follow a pre-set flight plan or travel within a small local area; plotting a new route to a distant location requires [Navigation](#navigation).
- **Common Attributes:** Precision, Reflexes
- **Advanced Specialties:** Atmospheric Flight, Close Quarters, Fighters, Freighters, Power Armor
- **General Specialties:** Space Flight, Shuttles, Frigates, Cruisers

###### Remote Weapons
Remotely Weapons represents a character's skill operating remotely-operated fly-by-wire weapons systems such as those mounted on vehicles, space stations, buildings, etc. It includes both the turreted and fixed weapons of vehicles, as well any weapon which is controlled via keyboard, joystick, or other indirect control mechanism. Firing remote weapons is usually a mental task, but quickly responding to and shooting down threats can require reflexes instead.
- **Common Attributes:** Wits, Reflexes
- **Advanced Specialties:** Defensive Fire, Power Armor, Mining Equipment, Advanced Maintenance
- **General Specialties:** PDCs, Missiles, Torpedoes, Rail Guns

###### Tradecraft
Tradecraft represents a character's skill at breaking into placing, stealing things, and conducting espionage. It's used to pick locks, disable alarms, hide weapons, set traps, disarm traps, and carry out other clandestine activity. Conducting a heist or breaking into a records vault will usually require some level of Tradecraft. However, making useful sense of the information stolen will usually require some level of [Investigation](#investigation).
- **Common Attributes:** Wits, Precision
- **Advanced Specialties:** Lockpick, Pickpocket, Alarms, Disarm Traps
- **General Specialties:**  Weapon Concealment, Dead Drops, Set Traps, Surveillance

##### Knowledges
Knowledges represent things that characters have learned through research or training.
If you would roll for a knowledge in which you have no dots, you cannot even attempt the action.
In some cases, the storyteller may allow an alternate roll or action to allow a character to "figure it out" and use the base attribute alone with a penalty.

###### Computer Science
Computer Science represents a character's knowledge of computer hardware and software development. It's used to create new programs, modify or build computer systems, create algorithms, train AI, find exploits, etc. However, interacting with existing tools and systems as an end-user usually requires [Technology](#technology) instead.
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence
- **Advanced Specialties:** Hacking, AI Research, Quantum Computing
- **General Specialties:** Encryption, Programming, Data Processing

###### Engineering
Engineering represents a character's ability to maintain, repair, and upgrade all the various systems usually found on a ship or space station. Similar to a vehicle mechanic, ships' engineers are able to install new parts or jury rig systems to bypass damaged parts. However, creating new parts usually requires [Manufacturing](#manufacturing). However, this trait can also be used to service ground vehicles, aircraft, power armor, outposts, and other mostly electromechanical objects.
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence, Wits
- **Advanced Specialties:** Jury Rigging, Power Armor, Weapon Systems, Reactors, Gravitics
- **General Specialties:**  Spacecraft, Aircraft, Stations, Ground Vehicles, Life Support, Electrical, Mining Equipment

###### Humanities
Humanities represents a character's knowledge about human societies, culture, history, languages and laws. It is primarily used to understand the political, social, historical, or cultural context of events. It's also used to understand specific languages or to study linguistics in general. (All characters are assumed to be fluent in a common language.)
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence
- **Advanced Specialties:** Law, Linguistics, Specific Language (Chinese, Russian, etc)
- **General Specialties:** History, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Literature, Anthropology

###### Manufacturing
Manufacturing represents a character's ability to create hard goods out of metals, plastics, ceramics, composites, etc. It includes both the knowledge required to properly operate manual manufacturing equipment and to create toolpaths and blueprints for autofabricators. While the goods produced by Manufacturing can be precisely machined parts and tools, they usually lack an artistic flair. For that, [Artistry](#artistry) is often used instead.
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence, Wits
- **Advanced Specialties:** Mechanical Design, Electronics, Explosives, Textiles
- **General Specialties:** Autofabrication, Manual Machining, Metals, Plastics, Ceramics, Composites

###### Medicine
Medicine represents a character's knowledge about the human body, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. It's used to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury or disease. It's also used to operate all non-automatic medical equipment and to use automatic equipment more effectively.
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence
- **Advanced Specialties:** Surgery, Battlefield Medicine, Zero-G, Prosthetics
- **General Specialties:**  First Aid, Wound Management, Poisons, Radiation

###### Science

- **Advanced Specialties:** Astrophysics, Quantum Theory, Gravitics, Jump Technology
- **General Specialties:**  Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science, Astronomy, Economics, Psychology, Sociology

###### Navigation
Navigation represents a character's knowledge orbital mechanics, trajectories, and maps. It's used to plot routes which are faster, use less fuel, avoid certain areas, limit visible engine burns, or approach the destination from a certain direction. This primarily applies to interplanetary routes, but can also be used for any planetary route long enough to warrant an aircraft. Once a satisfactory route is generated, [Piloting](#piloting) is usually required in order to correctly follow it.
- **Common Attributes:** Intelligence
- **Advanced Specialties:** Stealth, Close Approach, Precise Arrival, Jump Plotting
- **General Specialties:** Gravity Assists, Low Energy Transfers, Constant Thrust, Suborbital Routes

#### Specialties
Specialties represent areas where characters have focused their training or experience. Each specialty is connected to a single ability, but characters can unlock multiple specialties for each ability. There is no limit on the number of specialties which can be acquired for a given ability, but there is a limit for how many specialties can be used on a given roll. (See [Using Specialties](#using-specialties) for more details.)

Each ability is listed along with a number of suggested general and advanced specialties. However, these lists are not exhaustive. Work with your storyteller to add additional specialties that make sense for your character.

##### General Specialties
General Specialties represent focus in areas that are not otherwise considered exceptionally challenging. Characters with these specialties will generally perform better at related tasks, but characters without them are assumed to at least some general familiarity from the attribute and are not penalized.

##### Advanced Specialties
Advanced Specialties represent focus in areas that are more challenging or require specialized knowledge and practice. Characters with these specialties will perform better at related tasks, similar to general specialties. However, characters without them are at a significant disadvantage. Attempting an action without an appropriate advanced specialty usually adds a [threshold](#threshold) to the roll.

#### Willpower
All characters have a willpower trait which represents their capacity to push through pain, withstand mental or emotional stress, resist torture, and remain productive in the face of impossible odds. Willpower is commonly used to temporarily resist the effects of things like tear gas, drugs, alcohol, hypoxia, intense fear, and even wounds. It's also used to more quickly recover from the incapacitating effects of tasers, flashbangs, electrocution, etc.

Unlike other traits, willpower is on a scale from 1 to 10 and is always rolled alone. Additionally, willpower has both permanent and current ratings. A character's current dots can never exceed their permanent rating, but can be reduced and recovered through gameplay. When rolling or spending willpower, always use your character's _current_ dots, rather than their permanent rating.

After making a willpower roll, you may choose to [spend a willpower](#spending-willpower) dot to cancel your roll and succeed automatically. Your number of successes is set equal to your remaining willpower dots. (You may not spend your final willpower dot in this way, as doing so would result in zero successes and fail.)

Botching a willpower roll reduces your character's current willpower by one dot per uncancelled botch. In addition, you cannot spend willpower dots to cancel a botched roll. <!-- TODO Reconsider stacking willpower botches -->

##### Spending Willpower
Spending a willpower dot reduces your current willpower rating by one until you recover it. This allows you to ignore wounds or guarantee success on willpower rolls, but comes at the cost of reducing the dice pools for all future willpower rolls. Spent dots can be recovered, and the dice pools increased again, but only slowly and outside of combat.

In addition to spending dots to automatically succeed willpower rolls, you may also spend them to ignore wound penalties. Once per turn, a character may spend one willpower dot to ignore their injuries and roll their next action without a [wound penalty](#wound-penalties). (Note: Crippled limbs cannot be used to perform actions and willpower does not remove this effect.) If a character spends their last willpower dot in this way, they don't suffer the effects of [zero willpower](#zero-willpower) until after they complete the action.

##### Recovering Willpower
Characters recover willpower by resting in a safe, comfortable environment. If a character feels threatened or in danger, or if they are particularly uncomfortable, they are not able to recover willpower. This is up to the discretion of the storyteller.

If a character is able to recover willpower, they regain 1 dot of willpower per day. If they actively rest and relax for a day, they may regain 1 additional dot per success on a difficulty 8 willpower roll.

##### Zero Willpower
If a character is reduced to zero dots in willpower, either by botching a willpower roll or spending their last dot to resist their injuries, they no longer have the will to carry on. Characters in this state may not make any actions and are considered incapacitated. However, they will continue to act passively to keep pressure on their own wounds, hide, crawl away from danger, cooperate with other characters carrying or dragging them, etc.

If another character is sufficiently motivating or encouraging, they may spend one dot of their own willpower to restore nearby incapacitated characters to one dot. This can only be done at the discretion of the storyteller and will usually require roleplaying the manner in which the character convinces their companions to carry on the fight.

Characters can also recover their first dot in willpower by themselves once they are no longer directly threatened and out of combat for at least one full turn, even if their overall situation is still tenuous and stressful.

### Creating a Character
It's important to take the time to flesh out your [character](#characters)'s backstory and personality before you even start considering the numbers on you character sheet. Having an interesting character design before you start will make it a lot easier to pick out an interesting and varied selection of traits, backgrounds, and flaws.

Try to resist the urge to "min-max" your character and, instead, select the traits that most fit the personality and history of your character. Even if your character is going to be primarily a gunslinger, consider putting a couple dots in Artistry to reflect their sculpting hobby, or some dots in Law and Academics from back when they dropped out of law school. Remember, your storyteller will be able to weave those sorts of backgrounds into story hooks and challenges, but only if you have the traits to actually face them. Because of this, diverse and varied characters make the game more fun for everyone.

Once you're ready to sit down and start filling out a character sheet, you'll go through a few steps:
1. [Choose your backgrounds](#choose-backgrounds)
1. Select [starting attributes](#starting-attributes)
1. Select [starting abilities](#starting-attributes) and [starting specialties](#starting-specialties)
1. Spend [starting experience](#starting-experience)
1. Purchase [starting equipment](#starting-equipment)

<!-- TODO Add flaws -->

#### Choose Backgrounds
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe how to choose backgrounds -->

#### Starting Attributes
You automatically start with one dot in all six [attributes](#attributes). This is the minimum number for normal, healthy characters but almost all of your attributes will end up being higher than that.

Start by selecting either Physical or Mental as your primary attributes, the others are your secondary attributes. Then, allocate five (5) additional dots in your primary attributes and three (3) in your secondary attributes. You can arrange them however you want, but no attribute may exceed a total of four dots.

#### Starting Abilities
Unlike attributes, all [abilities](#abilities) start with zero dots.

Assign dots to your abilities with the following rules:
- Assign three (3) dots in two (2) abilities.
- Assign two(2) dots in another four (4) abilities.
- Assign one (1) dot in another six (6) abilities.
- You may not combine these dots; you must select twelve different abilities.
- You **must** have at least four total dots in each category (Talents, Skills, Knowledges).

When assigning dots, keep in mind that there is a penalty to use [skills](#skills) and that [knowledges](#knowledges) cannot be rolled at all if you don't have any dots in the ability. While it can be tempting to put as many dots as possible into [talents](#talents), it's usually better to spread out your dots somewhat evenly.

#### Starting Specialties
After selecting your starting abilities, you may choose a few starting specialties as well. Select one [Advanced Specialty](#advanced-specialties) and two [General Specialties](#general-specialties).

While you can technically take specialties in any ability, remember that you can only use one specialty per dot in the ability. So you won't be able to use a specialty if you don't have any dots in the ability.

Also, you are not necessarily restricted to the specialties listed. Work with your storyteller if you'd like to specialize in something not listed; they will determine if it's a reasonable specialty and whether or not it's general or advanced.

#### Starting Experience
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe starting experience -->

#### Starting Equipment
[Equipment](#equipment) will vary from campaign to campaign.
Work with your storyteller to determine reasonable starting equipment.
<!-- TODO Add actual rules for starting equipment -->

### Progression
Throughout the campaign, you'll earn experience. This experience can then be used to purchase trait dots and specialties.

#### Earning Experience
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe how to earn experience -->

#### Spending Experience
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe how to spend experience -->

## Actions
Characters do many things in the world; they drive cars, fly spaceships, shoot guns, investigate crime scenes, and so much more. Many of these actions are mundane or trivial and only require saying what your character is doing. (Nobody wants to roll dice to eat breakfast or drive their car through normal traffic.) For everything else, characters use their attributes and abilities, along with some dice, to determine if they succeed, fail, or royally screw things up.

<!-- TODO Differentiate between actions and reactions/defensive-actions -->

### Performing Actions
The first step of performing an action is to decide what your character is going to do and announce it. You might say, for example, "I hop on the motorcycle and fire it up." For many actions, this is all that's required. But for some actions, the storyteller may have you roll for it. The storyteller should take the situation into account as well when deciding whether players should roll. After all, it's really easy to start a motorcycle in your driveway for a lazy drive but it's a whole other thing to start it while under fire and trying to escape with your life.

Some actions are also just straight up impossible. No matter how much you say "I fly like a bird!" the only thing your character will end up doing is flapping their arms like a lunatic. Generally, the storyteller won't have you roll for these and just tell you that you fail or suggest that your character would know it was impossible before you even attempt it. However, a particularly mean storyteller may have you roll anyway, purely to determine exactly how hilariously you screw up.

While most things your character does are technically actions, you generally don't need to think about them individually. Outside of combat, players should just roleplay their characters, decide what they want to do, and do it. Try to avoid things like "Can I make a stealth check?" or "What do I need to roll to search the room?" Instead, describe what your character is doing: "I blend into the crowd and try to get out the back unnoticed" or "I grab my forensics kit and search the room, looking for anything that might be relevant to the case."  When a roll is needed, the storyteller will say so.

#### Dice Pool
When you announce an action that your storyteller wants you to roll for, they'll decide which traits you'll need to use. Usually, this will be an attribute and an ability. However, occasionally be one or two attributes will be used instead. While there may sometimes be only one trait used, there should never be more than two. The number of dice you'll roll, called your dice pool, is determined by how many dots you have in each of those traits: one die per dot for each trait.

> **Example:** A character is taking fire and the player decides to start his motorcycle and try to get away. The storyteller thinks that getting the key in the ignition and driving off without stalling is going to require precise movements and familiarity with the bike. She says to roll Precision + Drive. The player has three dots in Precision and two dots in Drive, so his dice pool contains a total of five dice.

Many actions can be accomplished in many different ways and with many different traits. Rather than just stating which action you'd like to perform, it's usually better to describe how you're trying to go about it. This will help the storyteller determine which traits to use and makes sure that your character performs the action in the way you intended. This also helps build your character's personality and demeanor in the minds of other players and leads to a richer roleplaying experience for everyone.

After you declare an action, the storyteller may offer a choice of different ways of performing it. They may also tell you which traits would be used for each option. While it can be tempting to just use whichever option gives you the larger dice pool, it's important to consider your character's personality and what their objectives are. Just because you're better at doing something a certain way doesn't necessarily mean that's the right way to try and do it. Keep in mind that different approaches may have different difficulties as well, so just having more dice doesn't mean it's going to be easier.

> **Example:** "I'm going to make my way through the crowd and follow the target." announces a player. The storyteller asks him if he'd like to push and shove people out of the way with Strength + Brawling or slip through gaps in the crowd with Precision + Streetwise. He knows he'd have more dice if he brute forces his way through, but he also knows that his character wouldn't want to make a big scene and draw attention. Ultimately, he decides to take the smaller dice pool and slip through the crowd instead.

#### Difficulty
Once you've decided what you're going to do and gotten your dice pool, the storyteller should specify a difficulty. Some storytellers will use the default difficulty for most actions and only mention it when it's different, rather than saying it every time. Your storyteller should make it clear how they intend to do this.

While the difficulty can be set anywhere between two and ten, it will usually be between four and eight with most actions having the default difficulty of six. When you roll your dice, you will get one success for each die which shows the difficulty number or higher. Additionally, you'll also get a botch for each die which shows a one. You lose one success for each botch and the total number of successes remaining then determines how well your character does. If manage to roll more botches than successes, you botch the roll and fail spectacularly.

>**Example:** A player is taking an action with a dice pool of five and a difficulty of six. He rolls and gets 1, 3, 4, 6, 7. Two dice are showing a six or better, so he gets two successes. But he also rolled a one and loses a success, for a total of one success remaining. Had the difficulty been higher, he would have wound up with zero successes and potentially botched the roll entirely.

#### Threshold
For particularly challenging or dangerous actions, the storyteller may specify a threshold. This represents how much effort it's going to take just to have a chance to succeed. Having a threshold means you are much more likely to fail and dramatically increases the chance of you failing catastrophically.

When you have a threshold, any successes you get up to that amount are removed immediately. Not only do they not count towards your total successes, they don't even count for avoiding botched rolls.

> **Example:** A player rolls for their action with a threshold of two. They roll two successes and a botch. The two successes are then immediately removed by the threshold, leaving zero successes and a botch. This is a botch, even though the roll would have been pretty okay without the threshold.

##### Required Specialties
In addition to the base threshold, the storyteller may specify one or more [advanced specialties](#advanced-specialties) which are required for the task you are attempting.
For each required specialty, increase the threshold by one unless you use that specialty.

#### Using Specialties
When you take an action that your character has one or more [specialties](#specialties) in, you can use those specialties to increase your odds of success and reduce the thresholds from [required specialties](#required-specialties).

In order to use a specialty, you must be using the ability that it's associated with. The specialty must also directly relate to the action you're taking. [Required specialties](#required-specialties) always relate to the action and, by using one, you get to ignore the threshold added by that specialty. However, you may only use one specialty per dot that your character has in the associated ability. This means that you cannot use a specialty at all if, for some reason, you don't have any dots in the ability. It also means that you may not be able to use all the required specialties for an action if you don't have enough dots, even if you have the specialties available. (Keep this in mind during character creation.) 

Finally, using at least one specialty on a roll grants the awesome power of "exploding tens": whenever you roll a 10 on any die in the roll, add two additional bonus dice. Like regular dice, any successes rolled on bonus dice count towards your overall successes. However, unlike regular dice, 1s are ignored instead of adding a botch. Even better, 10s on bonus dice count as well and can add _even more_ bonus dice. (That's why it's called exploding tens.)

The exploding tens effect doesn't stack, so using multiple specialties is only useful when they're required, but _having_ multiple specialties can be a cost-efficient way to increase your character's effectiveness in different circumstances.

> **Example:** A player is trying very long distance using a sniper rifle. The attack uses Precision + Firearms, has a difficulty of 8, and requires the Extreme Range advanced specialty. Her character has three dots in Precision and one dot in Firearms with the Pistols, Sniper Rifles, and Extreme Range specialties. Two of her specialties apply to the action, but she can only use one of them due to her rank in Firearms. She chooses to use the Extreme Range specialty so she can ignore the threshold from it.
>
> She rolls her dice pool and gets [1, 4, 7, 10]. The botch and a success cancel each other out but she's still allowed to add bonus dice for the ten. She rolls her two additional dice and gets [1, 10]. The 1 is ignored, because it's on a bonus die, and the 10 adds a success plus two more bonus dice. She rolls [4, 8] on these for one more success. Thanks to her specialties, she was able get two successes on an attack which would have otherwise botched.

#### Resolving the Result
Once you've determined your action, dice pool, and difficulty, it's time for some of that sweet, sweet randomness.

##### Step 1: Roll
Roll a number of ten-sided dice equal to your dice pool. Each die can have one of three results:
- Each die showing a number equal to or greater than your difficulty is a success.
- Each die showing a 1 is a botch.
- Each other die is a failure. (Sometimes called a simple failure.)

If you're using a specialty, also roll any bonus dice that you earn. Remember that 1s are not botches for bonus dice, so be sure to keep them separate.

##### Step 2: Count Successes
Count how many dice are showing a number equal to or greater than your difficulty number; these are your successes.

If you have a threshold, immediately remove that number of successes. Any successes removed in this way don't count at all and aren't considered cancelled; they effectively never happened at all. (Note: this affects successes, not the dice themselves. So it does not prevent you from adding bonus dice by using a speciality. It can still remove successes from those dice though.)

##### Step 3: Subtract Botches
Ones are bad. Count how many dice are showing a 1; these are your botches. Each botch you roll cancels one of your successes.

##### Step 4: Succeed, Fail, or Botch
If you still have any successes, then congratulations! You've succeeded your action. How well you did is determined by how many successes you still have. For most actions, a single success is enough to just barely make it while three or more means you did a really good job. The storyteller will describe your action and the potentially-glorious result.

If you had no successes or botches left, then you've simply failed. You weren't able to accomplish what you tried to do. You missed your shot, lost the person you were following, or couldn't hack the computer. The storyteller will describe what went wrong. Still, it could have been worse...

If you rolled more botches than successes, then you've botched. Not only did you fail, but things went very wrong. Perhaps the part you were trying to fix is permanently broke, or you gun is jammed, or you've crashed and ruined your car. Whatever it was, the storyteller will describe uncomfortable results of your utter failure ...usually in graphic detail.

##### Counting Dice Quickly
All this counting of dice can sound a little complicated and slow at first.

Fortunately, there's actually a really easy way to figure out your result quickly:
1. After you've rolled your dice, pick out the failures and remove them.
1. Roll bonus dice according to the specialty rules and discard failures.
    - Remember that 1s are simple failures on bonus dice, not botches.
1. If you have a threshold, take that many of the successes and remove them.
1. Pair up successes with botches and remove each pair.
1. If you have any successes left, you've succeeded with that many successes.
1. If you have any botches left, you've botched.
1. Otherwise, you've failed.

### Storyteller Suggestions
Sometimes it can be tricky to determine which traits should be used for an action, or what difficulty and threshold to set. This section provides some suggestions and tables to make it a little bit easier. However, it'll also vary greatly depending on what sort of game you're running and how much of a challenge you and your players want. Start with the guidelines here and then adjust to suit your story and your players.

#### Selecting Traits
To select the appropriate traits, it's important to be very familiar with the descriptions of all the [attributes](#attributes) and [abilities](#abilities). You should almost always choose one of each of these. Which ones will depend on exactly what the player is attempting to do and how they're trying to do it. Often times, there'll only be one combination that make sense. However, sometimes there will be several different options to choose from. In these cases, try to ask the player for more information about how they're trying to perform the task or let them choose which traits to use.

##### Precision vs Reflexes
Many tasks can be performed with either [precision](#precision) or [reflexes](#reflexes), depending on the preference of the player. However, they should not be treated equally.

Precision should not be allowed whenever the character is reacting to something sudden or unexpected, or if they had no way to mentally prepare for the event. As a rule, precision should only be used when the character is paying attention to the task since the previous round. For attacks, this means that they need to have either aimed or shot at their target last round and that they can't have gone fully behind cover since then. (They don't necessarily need a fully unbroken line of sight, but they need to have at least watched where they went.) Alternatively, they could make precision attacks against any targets inside a _small_ area which they've been actively covering since last turn.

Reflexes should always be allowed, but also generally be more difficult. Increase the difficulty by one whenever a player uses reflexes, as compared to an equivalent precision-based action. If you have players who want to primarily use reflexes for their combat actions, consider giving them equipment to mitigate this difficulty. One option is to call the increased difficulty a "Reflexive Action Penalty" and provide weapons which explicitly ignore it.

As always, remember to very the described outcomes to match the traits used to achieve them. For example: a character using precision to navigate a debris cloud might be described as "gracefully gliding through, maintaining the safest possible distance from each fragment", while a character using reflexes for the same thing might be described as "darting through gaps in the wreckage and deftly dodging bits of shrapnel as they wiz past".

#### Determining Difficulty
Importantly, the difficulty should never change _after_ the dice have been rolled.
<!-- TODO Describe how to determine what the difficulty should be -->
(_Oh no! There's a section missing here! Don't worry, I'm sure it'll turn up._)

At difficulty 10, a single die is as likely to botch as it is to succeed. Higher than that and success is completely impossible, since you can't roll an 11 on a ten-sided die. Because of this, it's usually a good idea to add a threshold instead of increasing the difficulty above 8 or 9.

#### Determining Thresholds
Some actions are so difficult that a simple success isn't enough and one or more successes are needed just to break even before progress can be made. For these actions, the storyteller can set a "threshold" of success. This threshold counts against any successes a character rolls, _before_ any ones are are counted. This not only makes it harder to get a success, but also makes it easier to botch. A little threshold goes a long way.

Usually, a threshold is used to set a task that is just extremely difficult to perform. In these cases, the action's difficulty is also set high. Just be sure to keep in mind that, with a high difficulty, the average number of rolled successes will be low. At difficulty 9, even a threshold of 1 makes for an extremely challenging feat. The odds of a botch are high and odds of failure even higher.

Thresholds can also be used to make tasks that aren't particularly difficult, but where there's a lot that can go wrong. This represents the need of the character to get a bunch of things right in order to succeed in their objective. In these cases, the action's difficulty is set lower -- sometimes even lower than normal -- and a reasonable threshold is used.

Finally, determine which [advanced specialt](#advanced-specialties) apply to the action and make them [required](#required-specialties).

> **Example:** "You climb the stairs and find yourself at the landing pad. There's no railings here, but there's a guard standing near the edge ahead of you. It's really windy all the way up here but you're pretty sure the metallic floor will make it extremely hard to sneak past him without being heard." describes the storyteller. The player decides she wants to charge the guard and push him over the edge before he can react.
>
> Considering the situation, the storyteller offers a choice: "It'd be so, so easy to budge him off the ledge, but you recognize that the loud, slippery floor makes this super dangerous. In game terms, it'll be strength plus athletics at difficulty 5 and a 2 threshold. You gonna go for it?" The player's character has pretty good stats and she decides to risk it. She picks up the dice...
>
> With a threshold of two, the player will immediately discard two successes from her roll. If she has no remaining successes and any ones, she botches. Otherwise, she subtracts her ones from her successes as usual. There's a few possible outcomes:
> - If she has at least one success remaining, she'll successfully push the guard off the edge. Only one success might give her a bit of a frightening close call, while more will have her move quickly and quietly.
> - If she has no remaining successes, but didn't botch, the guard hears her coming and pushes her back. They're both still on the platform but it's probably going to be a pretty scary fight.
> - If she botched, she successfully pushes the guard but slips and goes over the edge as well. The storyteller offers a reflex + strength check to try and grab onto the edge just in time.

## Starting a Campaign
Roleplaying games are fun, social experiences that brings friends together, and it all begins with session zero. To ensure that everyone is one the same page about what kind of game you're going to play, it's important to have this first session to discuss the game and create characters as a group. All the players, along with the storyteller, should discuss what kind of game you want to play together and what sort of stories you'll tell. Will it be a tense, resource-constrained horror game or an action-packed combat adventure? Will your party be social and friendly or classic murder-hobos? Will sessions generally revolve around solving puzzles or blowing things up?

By talking ahead of time about the kind of game you want to play, you make sure that everyone is on the same page and nobody is surprised when the wacky hack'n'slash adventure they were expecting turns out to be serious political intrigue. (Or vice-versa.) It also gives the players a chance to work together to build a balanced and cohesive party that has all the necessary skills to face the challenges ahead. Your space western game is going to be a lot less fun if it's all Simons and no Jaynes.
