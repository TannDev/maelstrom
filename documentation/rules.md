# Rules
The following rules provide a framework to help storytellers and players build their characters, take challenging actions, and get in fights. As with other roleplaying games, it's important to remember that the rules are only there to support the story and not to get in the way of it; storytellers are encouraged to adjust the rules where necessary to make things more fun, cinematic, and engaging.

## Characters
<!-- TODO Describe characters -->

### Backgrounds
<!-- TODO Describe backgrounds -->

### Traits
Traits define what a character is capable of. They are divided into two main categories: attributes and abilities. 

#### Attributes
Attributes are the intrinsic traits that broadly define the overall capabilities of a character. All characters have at least one dot in all attributes -- except under extreme exceptions -- with two dots being the human average. Almost all player characters will have 3-4 dots in a few attributes and some characters may have fewer than two dots in one or more attributes.

##### Physical
The physical attributes define the physical capabilities of a character.

###### Strength
Strength is pure muscle power and endurance. It's used for running, lifting, carrying, punching, and other activities where the limiting factor is the raw amount of physical effort the character is able to exert.
- **0**: Abysmal. You can barely even move under your own power. Most children are stronger than you. (Lift 20lbs)
- **1**: Poor. You're a couch potato. (Lift 40lbs)
- **2**: Average. You can probably do a couple pushups. (Lift 100lbs)
- **3**: Good. You work out or do heavy work for a living. (Lift 250lbs)
- **4**: Exceptional. You win Strong Man competitions. (Lift 400lbs)
- **5**: Outstanding. You are the Mountain that Rides. (Lift 600lbs)

###### Precision
Precision is hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity. It's used for acrobatics, parkour, thrown weapons, aimed shots, driving, and other activities where the limiting factor is the precision and accuracy of the character's motions.
- **0**: Abysmal. Walking is hard. Falling down is easy.
- **1**: Poor. You sometimes trip over perfectly smooth floors.
- **2**: Average. You usually at least hit the dart board and you can probably cross a balance beam.
- **3**: Good. You get bullseyes regularly and can cross a tight rope.
- **4**: Exceptional. You win dart competitions and parkour across rooftops.
- **5**: Outstanding. You're Deadshot, if he was in Cirque du Soleil.

###### Reflexes
Reflexes is reacting and taking actions quickly. It's used for quickdraws, dodging, unaimed shots, evasive maneuvers, and other activities where the limiting factor is reaction time.
- **0**: Abysmal. You're even surprised by your own actions.
- **1**: Poor. Sloths respond faster than you.
- **2**: Average. You can dodge a wrench (or a ball) if it's slow enough.
- **3**: Good. You can shoot from a holster and handle a fighter.
- **4**: Exceptional. You win speed shooting and drone racing competitions.
- **5**: Outstanding. Your quickdraw is better than Wyatt Earp.

##### Mental
The mental attributes define the mental capabilities of a character.

###### Perception
Perception is the ability to take in and process stimuli. It's used for searching, keeping watch, spotting threats, and other activities where the limiting factor is the ability to see, hear, feel, or smell.
- **0**: Abysmal. A fire alarm can go off without you noticing it.
- **1**: Poor. People sneak up on you without meaning to.
- **2**: Average. You lose your phone occasionally, but usually find it again.
- **3**: Good. You could be a detective or guard.
- **4**: Exceptional. Where's Waldo is too easy.
- **5**: Outstanding. Nothing escapes your notice. You see all.

###### Intelligence
Intelligence is the capacity to learn and apply information. It's used for research, mathematics, logical problem solving, and other activities where the limiting factor is education or reasoning.
- **0**: Abysmal. Ogg not know how make pointy stick. (Illiterate)
- **1**: Poor. You ain't much fer book learning. (High school or Less)
- **2**: Average. You can do your own taxes more or less correctly. (College/Trade School)
- **3**: Good. You can do other people's taxes correctly. (Post-Graduate/Master)
- **4**: Exceptional. You're a well known and respected thinker in your field.
- **5**: Outstanding. Hawking, Einstein, Tesla, Faraday... and you.

###### Wits
<!-- TODO Describe Wits ranks -->
- **0**: Abysmal.
- **1**: Poor.
- **2**: Average.
- **3**: Good.
- **4**: Exceptional.
- **5**: Outstanding.

#### Abilities
Abilities are the learned or developed traits that define the specific things a character knows how to do.
Many player characters will have 3-4 dots in a few abilities and almost all characters will have a couple dots in many different abilities.

Most abilities have lists of [general specialties](#general-specialties) and [advanced specialties](#advanced-specialties). These can be purchased so long as you have at least one dot in the ability. <!-- TODO Add character advancement link -->

##### Talents
Talents represent abilities that come naturally to characters, but which may have been honed and trained over the years.
When rolling for talents, there is no penalty for having zero dots -- just use the base attribute alone.

###### Alertness
Alertness represents a character's passive talent for being aware of their surroundings and noticing threats or items of interest.
- This trait is almost always rolled with Perception to do things like set watch around a camp, look for followers, spot an ambush, etc.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Night Vision, Vacuum
- **General Specialties:** Terrain (Urban, Forest, Plains, etc), Followers, Ambushes.

###### Athletics
Athletics represents a character's talent for physical agility. Where the physical attributes define a character's raw physical capabilities, their athletics defines their level of training and practice. This could be from physical training, sports, or other physical activities. It is also used for thrown weapons such as knives and grenades.
- This trait is almost always rolled with a physical attribute to do things like jump, climb, throw, run, etc.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Grenades, Power Armor, Zero-G, Acrobatics, Parkour, Specific Exotic Thrown Weapon
- **General Specialties:**  Run, Jump, Dodge, Thrown Weapons

###### Firearms
Firearms represents a character's talent with pistols, rifles, shotguns, and other similar weapons. This trait is also used as a skill -- rather than a talent -- to safely handle, reload, maintain, and these weapons.
- This trait is usually rolled with a physical attribute as part of an attack.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Power Armor, Energy Weapons, Extreme Range, Advanced Maintenance
- **General Specialties:** Pistols, Shotguns, PDWs, Battle Rifles, Sniper Rifles

###### Melee
Melee represents a character's talent in a close range fight. It includes both armed and unarmed combat and is used for fists, brass knuckles, swords, hammers, polearms, riot shields, and even the occasional wrench.
- This trait is usually rolled with a physical attribute as part of an attack or defensive maneuver.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Power Armor, Energy Weapons, Swords, Specific Exotic Melee Weapon
- **General Specialties:** Clubs, Grapple, Shields, Spears, Unarmed, Specific Martial Art

<!-- TODO Add Navigation? -->

###### Stealth
Stealth represents a character's talent in hiding, moving silently, and otherwise keeping out of sight.
- This trait is usually rolled with wits to hide and avoid detection or with precision to move silently.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Power Armor
- **General Specialties:** Terrain (Urban, Forests, Plains, etc), Armored, Unarmored

###### Streetwise
Stealth represents a character's talent for surviving and navigating urban environments. It is often used to safely navigate unfamiliar places, find people to buy or sell illicit goods, locate information brokers, and avoid getting mugged.
- This trait is usually rolled with wits to find places, routes, resources, or information.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Black Markets, Criminal Networks, Megacities
- **General Specialties:** Colonies, Outposts, Research Stations, Industrial Stations, Docks, Shipyards

##### Skills
Skills represent abilities that characters have learned through training and practice.
When rolling for a skill in which you have no dots, the difficulty is increased by 1. Then, use the base attribute alone.
In some cases, the storyteller may allow an alternate roll or action to allow a character to "figure it out" and avoid the penalty.

###### Driving
Driving represents a character's skill operating cars and other ground vehicles. It also includes fundamental user-serviceable tasks like refueling and changing tires, but maintenance usually requires [Engineering knowledge](#engineering).
- This trait is usually rolled with precision or reflexes in order to maneuver a ground vehicle.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Motorcycles, Transport Trucks
- **General Specialties:** Gravitic Vehicles, Cars, Trucks, Buses

###### Crafting
Crafting represents a character's skill creating works of art via drawing, sculpting, sewing, etc. Unlike [Manufacturing knowledge](#manufacturing), the Artistry ability doesn't usually result in useful, precisely-engineered items. However, it can still be used to create useful soft goods such as textiles, maps, documents, and even forgeries.
- This trait is usually rolled with varying attributes in order to create something.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Document Forgery, Art Forgery, Metalwork
- **General Specialties:** Sketching, Painting, Sculpting, Photography

###### Heavy Weapons
Heavy Weapons represents a character's skill with grenade launchers, RPGs, missile launchers, mortars, cannons, and other large, physically-operated weapons. It is also used to reload, disarm, and maintain these weapons.
- This trait is usually rolled with a physical attribute as part of an attack.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Power Armor, Mortars, Artillery, Advanced Maintenance
- **General Specialties:** Grenade Launchers, Missile Launchers

###### Investigation
Investigation represents a character's ability to gather evidence, make connections between events, and find hidden information. It covers processing crime scene, analysing forensics, searching records, and other general skills that might be used to crack the case and find the missing person ...or the target. Most investigation methods require access to people or information. This can often be acquired lawfully or with proper authorization. But, if not, it can sometimes be obtained via [Tradecraft skill](#tradecraft).
- **Advanced Specialties:** Missing Persons, Undercover
- **General Specialties:** Computer Records, Forensics, Crime Scenes, Surveillance

###### Piloting
Piloting represents a character's skill operating both aircraft and spacecraft.
With the ubiquity of high-efficiency aerospace thrusters, these craft are often quite similar. Generally, any character who is able to pilot one is also able to pilot the other. However, atmospheric flight -- along with some other types of maneuvers -- are generally more difficult.
- This trait is usually rolled with precision or reflexes in order to maneuver a aerospace vehicle.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Atmospheric Flight, Close Quarters, Fighters, Freighters, Power Armor
- **General Specialties:** Space Flight, Shuttles, Frigates, Cruisers

###### Remote Weapons
Remotely Weapons represents a character's skill operating remotely-operated fly-by-wire weapons systems such as those mounted on vehicles, space stations, buildings, etc. It includes both the turreted and fixed weapons of vehicles, as well any weapon which is controlled via keyboard, joystick, or other indirect control mechanism.
- This trait is usually rolled with wits, precision, or reflexes as part of an attack or defensive maneuver.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Defensive Fire, Power Armor, Mining Equipment, Advanced Maintenance
- **General Specialties:** PDCs, Missiles, Torpedoes, Rail Guns

###### Survival
Survival represents a character's skill surviving in harsh or austere environments.
- This trait is usually rolled with intelligence or wits to build shelters, find food, etc.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Vacuum, Non-Breathable Atmosphere, Extreme Temperatures, Radiation
- **General Specialties:** Terrain (Urban, Forests, Plains, etc), Space Stations, Spacecraft

###### Tradecraft
Tradecraft represents a character's skill at breaking into placing, stealing things, and conducting espionage. It's used to pick locks, disable alarms, hide weapons, set traps, and carry out other clandestine activity. Conducting a heist or breaking into a records vault will usually require some level of Tradecraft. However, making useful sense of the information stolen will usually require some level of [Investigation skill](#investigation).
- This trait is almost always rolled with wits or precision to gain access to protected areas or information.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Lockpick, Pickpocket, Alarms
- **General Specialties:**  Weapon Concealment, Dead Drops, Traps, Surveillance Devices

##### Knowledges
Knowledges represent things that characters have learned through research or training.
If you would roll for a knowledge in which you have no dots, you cannot even attempt the action.
In some cases, the storyteller may allow an alternate roll or action to allow a character to "figure it out" and use the base attribute alone with a penalty.

###### Academics
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Academics -->

###### Computer Systems
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Computer Systems -->
- **Advanced Specialties:** Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Data Recovery
- **General Specialties:** Programming, Security, Navigation Systems, Targeting Systems, Reactor Control

###### Engineering
Engineering represents a character's ability to maintain, repair, and upgrade all the various systems usually found on a ship or space station. Similar to a vehicle mechanic, ships' engineers are able to install new parts or jury rig systems to bypass damaged parts. However, creating new parts usually requires [Manufacturing knowledge](#manufacturing). However, this trait can also be used to service ground vehicles, aircraft, power armor, outposts, and other mostly electromechanical objects.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Jury Rigging, Power Armor, Weapon Systems, Reactors, Gravitics
- **General Specialties:**  Spacecraft, Aircraft, Stations, Ground Vehicles, Life Support, Electrical, Mining Equipment

###### Law
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Law -->

###### Linguistics
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Linguistics -->

###### Manufacturing
Manufacturing represents a character's ability to create hard goods out of metals, plastics, ceramics, composites, etc. It includes both the knowledge required to properly operate manual manufacturing equipment and to create toolpaths and blueprints for autofabricators. While the goods produced by Manufacturing can be precisely machined parts and tools, they usually lack an artistic flair. For that, [Crafting skill](#crafting) is often used instead.
- This trait is usually rolled with wits or intelligence to craft parts and equipment.
- **Advanced Specialties:** Mechanical Design, Explosives, Composite Materials, Textiles
- **General Specialties:** Autofabrication, Manual Machining, Metals, Plastics, Ceramics

###### Medicine
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Medicine -->
- **Advanced Specialties:** Surgery, Battlefield Medicine, Zero-G, Prosthetic
- **General Specialties:**  First Aid, Wound Management, Poisons, Radiation

###### Science
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Science -->
- **Advanced Specialties:** Quantum Theory, Gravitics, Jump Technology
- **General Specialties:**  Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Psychology, Astronomy

#### Specialties
Specialties represent areas where characters have focused their training or experience. Each specialty is connected to a single ability, but characters can unlock multiple specialties for each ability. There is no limit on the number of specialties which can be acquired for a given ability, but only one specialty can be used in any one roll per dot in the ability. (See [Using Abilities](#using-abilities) for more details.)

Each ability is listed along with a number of suggested general and advanced specialties. However, these lists are not exhaustive. Work with your storyteller to add additional specialties that make sense for your character.

##### General Specialties
General Specialties represent focus in areas that are not otherwise considered exceptionally challenging. Characters with these specialties will generally perform better at related tasks, but characters without them are assumed to at least some general familiarity from the attribute and are not penalized.

##### Advanced Specialties
Advanced Specialties represent focus in areas that are more challenging or require specialized knowledge and practice. Characters with these specialties will perform better at related tasks, similar to general specialties. However, characters without them are at a significant disadvantage. Attempting an action without an appropriate advanced specialty usually adds a [threshold](#threshold) to the roll.

### Health / Resistance
#### Health
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Health -->

##### Wound Penalties
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Wound Penalties -->

#### Fortitude
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Fortitude -->

#### Willpower
All characters have a willpower trait which represents their capacity to push through pain, withstand mental or emotional stress, resist torture, and remain productive in the face of impossible odds. Willpower is commonly used to temporarily resist the effects of things like tear gas, drugs, alcohol, hypoxia, intense fear, and even wounds. It's also used to more quickly recover from the incapacitating effects of tasers, flashbangs, electrocution, etc.

Unlike other traits, willpower is on a scale from 1 to 10 and is always rolled alone. Additionally, willpower has both permanent and current ratings. A character's current dots can never exceed their permanent rating, but can be reduced and recovered through gameplay. When rolling or spending willpower, always use your character's _current_ dots, rather than their permanent rating.

After making a willpower roll, you may choose to [spend a willpower](#spending-willpower) dot to cancel your roll and succeed automatically. Your number of successes is set equal to your remaining willpower dots. (You may not spend your final willpower dot in this way, as doing so would result in zero successes and fail.)

Botching a willpower roll reduces your character's current willpower by one dot per uncancelled botch. In addition, you cannot spend willpower dots to cancel a botched roll. <!-- TODO Reconsider stacking willpower botches -->

##### Spending Willpower
Spending a willpower dot reduces your current willpower rating by one until you recover it. This allows you to ignore wounds or guarantee success on willpower rolls, but comes at the cost of reducing the dice pools for all future willpower rolls. Spent dots can be recovered, and the dice pools increased again, but only slowly and outside of combat.

In addition to spending dots to automatically succeed willpower rolls, you may also spend them to ignore wound penalties. Once per turn, a character may spend one willpower dot to ignore their injuries and roll their next action without a wound penalty. (Note: Crippled limbs cannot be used to perform actions and willpower does not remove this effect.) If a character spends their last willpower dot in this way, they don't suffer the effects of [zero willpower](#zero-willpower) until after they complete the action.

##### Recovering Willpower
Characters recover willpower by resting in a safe, comfortable environment. If a character feels threatened or in danger, or if they are particularly uncomfortable, they are not able to recover willpower. This is up to the discretion of the storyteller.

If a character is able to recover willpower, they regain 1 dot of willpower per day. If they actively rest and relax for a day, they may regain 1 additional dot per success on a difficulty 8 willpower roll.

##### Zero Willpower
If a character is reduced to zero dots in willpower, either by botching a willpower roll or spending their last dot to resist their injuries, they no longer have the will to carry on. Characters in this state may not make any actions and are considered incapacitated. However, they will continue to act passively to keep pressure on their own wounds, hide, crawl away from danger, cooperate with other characters carrying or dragging them, etc.

If another character is sufficiently motivating or encouraging, they may spend one dot of their own willpower to restore nearby incapacitated characters to one dot. This can only be done at the discretion of the storyteller and will usually require roleplaying the manner in which the character convinces their companions to carry on the fight.

Characters can also recover their first dot in willpower by themselves once they are no longer directly threatened and out of combat for at least one full turn, even if their overall situation is still tenuous and stressful.

### Equipment
_Description TBD_ <!-- TODO Describe Equipment -->

## Actions
Characters do many things in the world; they drive cars, fly spaceships, shoot guns, investigate crime scenes, and so much more. Many of these actions are mundane or trivial and only require saying what your character is doing. (Nobody wants to roll dice to eat breakfast or drive their car through normal traffic.) For everything else, characters use their attributes and abilities, along with some dice, to determine if they succeed, fail, or royally screw things up.

<!-- TODO Differentiate between actions and reactions/defensive-actions -->

### Declaring an action
The first step of performing an action is to decide what your character is going to do and announce it. You might say, for example, "I hop on the motorcycle and fire it up." For many actions, this is all that's required. But for some actions, the storyteller may have you roll for it. The storyteller should take the situation into account as well when deciding whether players should roll. After all, it's really easy to start a motorcycle in your driveway for a lazy drive but it's a whole other thing to start it while under fire and trying to escape with your life.

Some actions are also just straight up impossible. No matter how much you say "I fly like a bird!" the only thing your character will end up doing is flapping their arms like a lunatic. Generally, the storyteller won't have you roll for these and just tell you that you fail or suggest that your character would know it was impossible before you even attempt it. However, a particularly mean storyteller may have you roll anyway, purely to determine exactly how hilariously you screw up.

While most things your character does are technically actions, you generally don't need to think about them individually. Outside of combat, players should just roleplay their characters, decide what they want to do, and do it. Try to avoid things like "Can I make a stealth check?" or "What do I need to roll to search the room?" Instead, describe what your character is doing: "I blend into the crowd and try to get out the back unnoticed" or "I grab my forensics kit and search the room, looking for anything that might be relevant to the case."  When a roll is needed, the storyteller will say so.

### Dice Pool
When you announce an action that your storyteller wants you to roll for, they'll decide which traits you'll need to use. Usually, this will be an attribute and an ability. However, occasionally be one or two attributes will be used instead. While there may sometimes be only one trait used, there should never be more than two. The number of dice you'll roll, called your dice pool, is determined by how many dots you have in each of those traits: one die per dot for each trait.

> **Example:** A character is taking fire and the player decides to start his motorcycle and try to get away. The storyteller thinks that getting the key in the ignition and driving off without stalling is going to require precise movements and familiarity with the bike. She says to roll Precision + Drive. The player has three dots in Precision and two dots in Drive, so his dice pool contains a total of five dice.

Many actions can be accomplished in many different ways and with many different traits. Rather than just stating which action you'd like to perform, it's usually better to describe how you're trying to go about it. This will help the storyteller determine which traits to use and makes sure that your character performs the action in the way you intended. This also helps build your character's personality and demeanor in the minds of other players and leads to a richer roleplaying experience for everyone.

After you declare an action, the storyteller may offer a choice of different ways of performing it. They may also tell you which traits would be used for each option. While it can be tempting to just use whichever option gives you the larger dice pool, it's important to consider your character's personality and what their objectives are. Just because you're better at doing something a certain way doesn't necessarily mean that's the right way to try and do it. Keep in mind that different approaches may have different difficulties as well, so just having more dice doesn't mean it's going to be easier.

> **Example:** "I'm going to make my way through the crowd and follow the target." announces a player. The storyteller asks him if he'd like to push and shove people out of the way with Strength + Brawling or slip through gaps in the crowd with Precision + Streetwise. He knows he'd have more dice if he brute forces his way through, but he also knows that his character wouldn't want to make a big scene and draw attention. Ultimately, he decides to take the smaller dice pool and slip through the crowd instead.

### Difficulty
Once you've decided what you're going to do and gotten your dice pool, the storyteller should specify a difficulty. Some storytellers will use the default difficulty for most actions and only mention it when it's different, rather than saying it every time. Your storyteller should make it clear how they intend to do this.

While the difficulty can be set anywhere between two and ten, it will usually be between four and eight with most actions having the default difficulty of six. When you roll your dice, you will get one success for each die which shows the difficulty number or higher. Additionally, you'll also get a botch for each die which shows a one. You lose one success for each botch and the total number of successes remaining then determines how well your character does. If manage to roll more botches than successes, you botch the roll and fail spectacularly.

>**Example:** A player is taking an action with a dice pool of five and a difficulty of six. He rolls and gets 1, 3, 4, 6, 7. Two dice are showing a six or better, so he gets two successes. But he also rolled a one and loses a success, for a total of one success remaining. Had the difficulty been higher, he would have wound up with zero successes and potentially botched the roll entirely.

### Threshold
For particularly challenging or dangerous actions, the story teller may specify a threshold. This represents how much effort it's going to take just to have a chance to succeed. Having a threshold means you are much more likely to fail and dramatically increases the chance of you failing catastrophically.

When you have a threshold, any successes you get up to that amount are removed immediately. Not only do they not count towards your total successes, they don't even count for avoiding botched rolls.

> **Example:** A player rolls for their action with a threshold of two. They roll two successes and a botch. The two successes are then immediately removed by the threshold, leaving zero successes and a botch. This is a botch, even though the roll would have been pretty good without the threshold.

### Using Specialties
If you use a an ability that your character has a specialty in, you can sometimes use that specialty to increase your odds of success. Specialties don't add to the dice pool directly, like attributes or abilities; instead, they have a chance to add bonus dice on a good roll.

<!-- TODO Rewrite this section to clarify when specialties can be used and how advanced specialties affect thresholds -->

In order to use a specialty, your action needs to be related to the specialty. Multiple specialties can be used at the same time, if they apply, up to a maximum of one specialty per dot in the ability.
 
For each specialty in use, add one additional bonus die every time you roll a 10 on any die. Like regular dice, any successes rolled on your bonus dice count to your overall successes. However, 1s are ignored and do not add a botch. Finally, any 10s rolled on bonus dice count for specialties as well and add even more bonus dice - this is sometimes called "exploding tens".

Additionally, whenever you make an action which requires an advanced specialty, your storyteller will add one threshold to your roll. If you use the advanced specialty required, you may remove that threshold.

> **Example:** A player is trying to attack with a sniper rifle. The attack uses Precision + Firearms and has a difficulty of 8. Her character has two dots in Precision and three dots in Firearms with a specialty in sniping. Because action is relevant to her specialty, she's allowed to use the speciality and gains exploding tens. She rolls five dice as usual and gets [1, 4, 8, 10, 10] for a total of two successes. Because of the tens, she's able to add two bonus dice as well. She rolls a 1 and a 10 on the bonus dice. Because it's on a bonus die, the 1 is ignored. The 10 adds a success (for a total of three) and another bonus die. On the new bonus die, she rolls an 8 for her fourth and final success.

### Resolving the Result
Once you've determined your action, dice pool, and difficulty, it's time for some of that sweet, sweet randomness.

#### Step 1: Roll
Roll a number of ten-sided dice equal to your dice pool and roll any bonus dice due to specialties.

Each die can have one of three results:
- Each die showing a number equal to or greater than your difficulty is a success
- Each die showing a 1 is a botch.
- Each other die is a failure (sometimes called a simple failure)

#### Step 2: Count Successes
Count how many dice are showing a number equal to or greater than your difficulty number; these are your successes.

If you have a threshold, immediately remove that number of successes. Any successes removed in this way don't count at all and aren't considered cancelled; they effectively never happened at all. (Note: this affects successes, not the dice themselves. So it does not prevent you from adding additional dice by using a speciality. It can still remove successes from added dice, however.)

#### Step 3: Subtract Botches
Ones are bad. Count how many dice are showing a 1; these are your botches. Each botch you roll cancels one of your successes.

#### Step 4: Succeed, Fail, or Botch
If you still have any successes, then congratulations! You've succeeded your action. How well you did is determined by how many successes you still have. For most actions, a single success is enough to just barely make it while three or more means you did a really good job. The storyteller will describe your action and the potentially-glorious result.

If you had no successes or botches left, then you've simply failed. You weren't able to accomplish what you tried to do. You missed your shot, lost the person you were following, or couldn't hack the computer. The storyteller will describe what went wrong. Still, it could have been worse...

If you rolled more botches than successes, then you've botched. Not only did you fail, but things went very wrong. Perhaps the part you were trying to fix is permanently broke, or you gun is jammed, or you've crashed and ruined your car. Whatever it was, the storyteller will describe uncomfortable results of your utter failure ...usually in graphic detail.

#### Easy Counting Trick
All this counting of dice can sound a little complicated and slow at first.

Fortunately, there's actually a really easy way to figure out your result quickly:
1. After you've rolled your dice, pick out the failures and remove them.
1. Roll bonus dice according to the specialty rules and discard failures.
    - Remember that 1s are simple failures on bonus dice, not botches.
1. If you have a threshold, take that many of the successes and remove them.
1. Pair up successes with botches and remove each pair.
1. If you have any successes left, you've succeeded with that many successes.
1. If you have any botches left, you've botched.
1. Otherwise, you've failed.

### Storyteller Suggestions
Even after you've figured out what traits to use for your player's action, determining what difficulties and thresholds to set can be tricky sometimes. This section provides some suggestions and tables to make it a little bit easier. However, it'll also vary greatly depending on what sort of game you're running and how much of a challenge you and your players want. Start with the guidelines here and then adjust to suit your story and your players.

#### Determining Difficulty
Importantly, the difficulty should never change _after_ the dice have been rolled.
<!-- TODO Describe how to determine what the difficulty should be -->
(_Oh no! There's a section missing here! Don't worry, I'm sure it'll turn up._)

At difficulty 10, a single die is as likely to botch as it is to succeed. Higher than that and success is completely impossible, since you can't roll an 11 on a ten-sided die. Because of this, it's usually a good idea to add a threshold instead of increasing the difficulty above 8 or 9.

#### Determining Thresholds
Some actions are so difficult that a simple success isn't enough and one or more successes are needed just to break even before progress can be made. For these actions, the storyteller can set a "threshold" of success. This threshold counts against any successes a character rolls, _before_ any ones are are counted. This not only makes it harder to get a success, but also makes it easier to botch. A little threshold goes a long way.

Usually, a threshold is used to set a task that is just extremely difficult to perform. In these cases, the action's difficulty is also set high. Just be sure to keep in mind that, with a high difficulty, the average number of rolled successes will be low. At difficulty 9, even a threshold of 1 makes for an extremely challenging feat. The odds of a botch are high and odds of failure even higher.

Thresholds can also be used to make tasks that aren't particularly difficult, but where there's a lot that can go wrong. This represents the need of the character to get a bunch of things right in order to succeed in their objective. In these cases, the action's difficulty is set lower -- sometimes even lower than normal -- and a reasonable threshold is used.

Finally, add one threshold for each advanced specialty that applies to the action. But make sure your players are aware of the reason for the threshold, so they can ignore it if they are able to use the required specialty.

> **Example:** "You climb the stairs and find yourself at the landing pad. There's no railings here, but there's a guard standing near the edge ahead of you. It's really windy all the way up here but you're pretty sure the metallic floor will make it extremely hard to sneak past him without being heard." describes the storyteller. The player decides she wants to charge the guard and push him over the edge before he can react.

> Considering the situation, the storyteller offers a choice: "It'd be so, so easy to budge him off the ledge, but you recognize that the loud, slippery floor makes this super dangerous. In game terms, it'll be strength plus athletics at difficulty 5 and a 2 threshold. You gonna go for it?" The player's character has pretty good stats and she decides to risk it. She picks up the dice...
>
> With a threshold of two, the player will immediately discard two successes from her roll. If she has no remaining successes and any ones, she botches. Otherwise, she subtracts her ones from her successes as usual. There's a few possible outcomes:
> - If she has at least one success remaining, she'll successfully push the guard off the edge. Only one success might give her a bit of a frightening close call, while more will have her move quickly and quietly.
> - If she has no remaining successes, but didn't botch, the guard hears her coming and pushes her back. They're both still on the platform but it's probably going to be a pretty scary fight.
> - If she botched, she successfully pushes the guard but slips and goes over the edge as well. The storyteller offers a reflex + strength check to try and grab onto the edge just in time.

## Starting a Campaign
Roleplaying games are fun, social experiences that brings friends together, and it all begins with session zero. To ensure that everyone is one the same page about what kind of game you're going to play, it's important to have this first session to discuss the game and create characters as a group. All the players, along with the storyteller, should discuss what kind of game you want to play together and what sort of stories you'll tell. Will it be a tense, resource-constrained horror game or an action-packed combat adventure? Will your party be social and friendly or classic murder-hobos? Will sessions generally revolve around solving puzzles or blowing things up?

By talking ahead of time about the kind of game you want to play, you make sure that everyone is on the same page and nobody is surprised when the wacky hack'n'slash adventure they were expecting turns out to be serious political intrigue. (Or vice-versa.) It also gives the players a chance to work together to build a balanced and cohesive party that has all the necessary skills to face the challenges ahead. Your space western game is going to be a lot less fun if it's all Simons and no Jaynes.

## Character Creation
Your character is your avatar in the game world and they will define who you are and what you are able to do. It's important to take the time to flesh out their backstory and personality before you even start considering the numbers on you character sheet. Having an interesting character design before you start will make it a lot easier to pick out an interesting and varied selection of traits, backgrounds, and flaws.

Try to resist the urge to "min-max" your character and, instead, select the traits that most fit the personality and history of your character. Even if your character is going to be primarily a gunslinger, consider putting a couple dots in Crafting to reflect their sculpting hobby, or some dots in Law and Academics from back when they dropped out of law school. Remember, your storyteller will be able to weave those sorts of backgrounds into story hooks and challenges, but only if you have the traits to actually face them. Because of this, diverse and varied characters make the game more fun for everyone.

Once you're ready to sit down and start filling out a character sheet, you'll go through a few steps:
1. [Choose your backgrounds](#choose-backgrounds)
1. Select [starting attributes](#starting-attributes)
1. Select [starting abilities](#starting-attributes) and [starting specialties](#starting-specialties)
1. Spend [starting experience](#starting-experience)
1. Purchase [starting equipment](#starting-equipment)
