Information about the people, places, and technology of the Maelstrom universe

## Places

## Sol
Birthplace of Humanity, the Sol system remains the most populated of all the settled systems. Major settlements include Earth, Luna, Mars, and Titan. Minor settlements are spread throughout the system on other moons, asteroids, and artificial stations.

### Earth
Boasting a massive population of over 25 billion people, Earth bears the scars of humankind's industrial and post-industrial development with large sections of the planet considered toxic and inhospitable. With most of the world's ecosystems destroyed, ongoing conservation efforts are needed to maintain life on the planet. Large-scale geoengineering projects seek to maintain the planet's fragile environment. Atmospheric composition and magnetic field strength are almost entirely maintained by massive machinery, along with previously-natural systems such as the North Atlantic Current.

Even with all this technology, most of the planet is unable to support crops or settlements. Most of the planet's residents live in enormous mega cities spread around the globe. Atmospheric scrubbers handle pollution from these cities while sophisticated storm defense networks keep them safe from the powerful storms that ravage the rest of the planet.

Agriculture is conducted entirely indoors with "sustainable buildings" being the norm in many places. These buildings provide residents with essentials such as food, recycled water, and power. Rural areas, outside the major cities, remain mostly unpopulated but support mechanized auto-farms -- heavily reenforced structures in which AI-controlled robotic equipment grow food and other organic resources on an industrial scale. Earth's remaining needs are provided by orbital gardens and imports from other settled planets.

Several extremist groups oppose these technologies and believe that humanity should stop interferring with the planet. These groups have various different rationales, bust most agree that humanity should either leave Earth or die out completely. Attacks on geoengineering projects, auto-farms, and power stations are common. Because of this, as well as the densely-packed population, security on the planet is extremely tight and many regions enforce harsh penalties for even small crimes.

#### Luna
Earth's moon, now officially named Luna, was humanity's second extra-terrestrial colony and first sub-planet-scale terraforming project. Several hundred million people live and work on the surface of Luna in dense colonies. Since the small body does not have enough gravity to maintain a liveable atmosphere by itself, these colonies use atmosphere generators to fill large protective domes. In addition to providing a breathable atmosphere, most of these domes also contain artifical lighting and electrochromic glass in order to maintain an artificial Earth-like day/night cycle. Some of the newer, more comfortable settlements even include gravitics to that residents can enjoy Earth-like gravity. (One settlement attempted to use gravitics to contain the atmosphere as well and omit the dome. However, this proved fatal for all residents when the settlement's power generators failed.)

With very few resources available, the primary industries on Luna are research and manufacturing. The low gravity makes it easy to transport material to and from the surface, while the short distance to Earth allows for efficient real-time communication. Because of this, Luna does not have an independant government and is mostly under the shared control of various Earth-based corporations and nations.
